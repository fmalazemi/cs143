## 🚀 What You'll Learn

### From Python to C++

Building on your CS 101 Python knowledge:

- ✅ **Variables** - But now with static typing (types don't change!)
- ✅ **Loops** - `for`, `while` work similarly but with new syntax
- ✅ **Conditionals** - `if/else` with C++ style
- 🆕 **Compilation** - Write once, compile, run super fast (10-100x faster!)
- 🆕 **Memory Management** - Direct control over computer resources
- 🆕 **Object-Oriented Design** - Build large, maintainable programs

### Key Programming Concepts

1. **Control Structures** - Master decision-making and repetition
2. **Functions** - Write modular, reusable code
3. **Recursion** - Solve problems by breaking them into smaller pieces
4. **Data Structures** - Organize and manage data efficiently
5. **OOP Principles** - Design software like a professional
6. **File Processing** - Read from and write to files
7. **Algorithms** - Search and sort data like a pro

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Coming from Python?

**What's Different:**
- 📌 **Static typing** - Declare types and they never change
- 📌 **Compilation** - Two steps: compile then run
- 📌 **Semicolons** - Every statement ends with `;`
- 📌 **Curly braces** - Use `{ }` instead of indentation
- 📌 **Manual memory** - More control, more responsibility

**What's Similar:**
- ✅ Variables, loops, conditionals work the same way
- ✅ Functions and parameters are familiar concepts
- ✅ Problem-solving logic transfers directly
- ✅ Your programming skills are already strong!

### Study Strategies

1. **Practice daily** - Code every day, even if just 15 minutes
2. **Type code yourself** - Don't just copy/paste
3. **Debug errors** - They're learning opportunities
4. **Attend labs** - Hands-on practice is crucial
5. **Ask questions** - Use Moodle forums and office hours
6. **Form study groups** - Learn together
